## Loading and preprocessing the data

setwd("C:/Users/SAURAV/Downloads/repdata_data_activity")
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv")
```
Loading this data
```{r}
dim(activity)
names(activity)
head(activity)
str(activity)
#total number of missing data
sum(is.na(activity$steps))/dim(activity)[[1]]
#transforming the date column into date format using lubridate
library(lubridate)
activity$date<-ymd(activity$date)
length(unique(activity$date))
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r, echo = TRUE}
activity_total_steps <- with(activity, aggregate(steps, by = list(date), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))
names(activity_total_steps) <- c("date", "steps")
hist(activity_total_steps$steps, main = "Total number of steps taken per day", xlab = "Total steps taken per day", col = "blue", ylim = c(0,20), breaks = seq(0,25000, by=2500))
mean(activity_total_steps$steps)
median(activity_total_steps$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
average_daily_activity <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
names(average_daily_activity) <- c("interval", "mean")
plot(average_daily_activity$interval, average_daily_activity$mean, type = "l", col="darkblue", lwd = 2, xlab="Interval", ylab="Average number of steps", main="Average number of steps per intervals")
average_daily_activity[which.max(average_daily_activity$mean), ]$interval
```

## Imputing missing values
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
imputed_steps <- average_daily_activity$mean[match(activity$interval, average_daily_activity$interval)]
activity_imputed <- transform(activity, steps = ifelse(is.na(activity$steps), yes = imputed_steps, no = activity$steps))
total_steps_imputed <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity_imputed, sum)
names(total_steps_imputed) <- c("date", "daily_steps")
hist(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps, col = "darkblue", xlab = "Total steps per day", ylim = c(0,30), main = "Total number of steps taken each day", breaks = seq(0,25000,by=2500))
mean(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps)
median(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps)

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
activity$date <- as.Date(strptime(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d"))
activity$datetype <- sapply(activity$date, function(x) {
        if (weekdays(x) == "SÃ¡bado" | weekdays(x) =="Domingo") 
                {y <- "Weekend"} else 
                {y <- "Weekday"}
                y
        })
        activity_by_date <- aggregate(steps~interval + datetype, activity, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot<- ggplot(activity_by_date, aes(x = interval , y = steps, color = datetype)) +
       geom_line() +
       labs(title = "Average daily steps by type of date", x = "Interval", y = "Average number of steps") +
       facet_wrap(~datetype, ncol = 1, nrow=2)
print(plot)
